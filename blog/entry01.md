# Entry 1: Deciding on My Topic 
##### 10/11/25

## How I chose my topic 
The topic I chose for my project was **Education** because I enjoy helping people. As a kid I always played pretend school by teaching my stuffed animals random math problems as if they're real students and still today I use teaching as a technique to study. Part of education is the diverse way people learn so I knew I had to make education better somehow by incorporating technology. Some topics I've thought of were Residential Architecture or Travel but ultimately I chose education since it's been the career I've been thinking of since I was in middle school. Some articles I researched about the topics I thought of and the topic I chose includes "[What We've Learned About Technology and Learning in The Last 3 Years](https://www.edweek.org/technology/what-weve-learned-about-technology-and-learning-in-the-last-3-years/2023/03)" by EducationWeek, "[How Has Technology Changed Education](https://education.purdue.edu/2024/01/how-has-technology-changed-education/)" by Purdue University, [How Smart Home Technology Has Transformed Residential Design](https://webberstudio.com/how-smart-home-technology-has-transformed-residential-design/) by WebberStudio, and [The Impact of Technology on Travel](https://www.traveltek.com/blog/impact-of-technology-on-travel/) by TravelTek. All these articles helped me realize different ways technology has impacted education and gives me a better idea of how I can incorporate technology in education. 

## Engineering Design Process
I'm on my first step of the engineering design process which is to find the problem I hope to solve with my project. One major problem is how distracting technology can be for students with social media and video games. I plan to continue to research problems and solutions about my topic. 

## Skills 
Some skills I learned while working on this blog are **How to Google** and **Developing Critical Thinking skills**

#### How to google 
Researching about technology and education wasn't easy, especially with over millions of results. But as I continued to research more about my topic I realized looking at titles and sources better helped me find the information I needed. 

#### Developing research skills 
Critical thinking has many benefits which this blog helped me develop. Working on this project helped me learn how to process information in articles and turn it into my own words.
