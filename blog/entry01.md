# Entry 1: Deciding on My Topic 
##### 10/11/25

## How I chose my topic 
The topic I chose for my project was **Education** because I enjoy helping people. As kid I always played pretend school by teaching  my stuffed animals random math problems as if theyre real students and still today I use teaching a technique to study. Part of education is the diverse way people learn so I knew I had to make a education easier some how by incorporating technology. Some articles I researched about education and technology includes "[What We've Leanred About Technology and Learning in The Last 3 Years](https://www.edweek.org/technology/what-weve-learned-about-technology-and-learning-in-the-last-3-years/2023/03)" by EducationWeek, "[How Has Technology Changed Education](https://education.purdue.edu/2024/01/how-has-technology-changed-education/)" by Purdue University, and [7 Research Findings About Technology and Education](https://www.edutopia.org/article/research-effectiveness-technology-learning) by Edutopia. All these articles helped me realzie different ways technology has impacted education and gives me a better idea of how I can incorpurate technology in education. 

## Engineering Design Process
Im on my first step of the engineering design process which is to find the problem I hope to solve with my project. One major problem is how distracting technology can be for students with social media and video games. I plan to continue to research about problems and soutions about my topic. 

## Skills 
Some skills I learned while working on this blog are **How to Google** and **Developing Critical Thinking skills**

#### How to google 
Researching about technology and edeucation wasnt easy especially with over millions of results. But as I continued to research more about my topic I realized looking at titles and sources better helped me find the information I needed. 

#### Developing research skills 
Critical thinking has many benifits which this blog helped me develope. Working on this project helped me learn how to process information in articles and turn it into my own words.
