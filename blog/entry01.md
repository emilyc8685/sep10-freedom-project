# Entry 1: Deciding on My Topic 
##### 10/11/25

## How I chose my topic 
The topic I chose for my project was **Education** because I enjoy helping people. As kid I always played pretend school by teaching  my stuffed animals random math problems as if theyre real students and still today I use teaching a technique to study. Part of education is the diverse way people learn so I knew I had to make a education easier some how by incorporating technology. Some articles I researched about education and technology includes "[https://www.edweek.org/](https://www.edweek.org/technology/what-weve-learned-about-technology-and-learning-in-the-last-3-years/2023/03)" by EducationWeek
