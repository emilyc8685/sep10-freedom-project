## How I found it
To find some softwares and hardware that was created in my topic I first googled "Education softwares" I got a lot of results of common softwares like Google Classroom and Kahoot. Instead I searched "unique educational softwares/apps" and "unique educational gadgets/hardware which helped me get the results I wanted.  

## Engineering Design Process (EDP)
I'm on my second stage of the engineering design process which is to research the problem about my topic, education. One problem I found while researching is how distracting technology can be for students. Social media and video games can be distracting and unmotivate students to learn more. While researching I found some softwares and hardwares that can motivate students to learn from and stay engaged in. I continue to brainstorm possible solutions about technology in my topic.

## Skills 
#### Note-taking
I learned how to take notes better by summarizing and prioritizing information I reserached. By summarizing information it made my notes more understandable and helped me process the information I researched. Prioritizing the information I processed made it easier to capture the main idea and not unnecessary details that wouldn't help me. 

#### How to google 
I've learned how to google better while researching about eduactional softwares. I got results I didn't want such as google classroom and kahoot which were software that most people know. Instead I used keywords like unique that helped me find softwares that most people dont know about and got me the results I wanted.
