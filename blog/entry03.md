### How I brainstormed Part B
 I thought of future technology in education by thinking of ways students can be more engaged in learning. Many students tend to get distracted easily while studying and teachers struggle to keep students engaged in class. Looking at pervious projects for inspiration such as [Oceanography by Austin Liu](https://austinl1905.github.io/sep10-freedom-project/) and [Cooking by Caron Voon](https://caronv3030.github.io/sep10-freedom-project/startbootstrap-small-business-master/dist/index.html#contact) as well as already created software and hardware (my part A) i've come up with an idea where technology can help with this problem. A desk with a built-in screen that comes with an educational app. 

### Engineering Design Process (EDP)
I'm on my third stage of the engineering design process which is to brainstorm possible solutions. I thought of creating a desk with a built-in screen that comes with an educational app. My next step is to plan the most promising solution. 

  * It's just a flat desk where students could have their notes on the side and also a screen built into the desk
  * This can also be combination of software and hardware
  * It comes with educational apps built into the screen/tablet so students won't get distracted 
  * The app has all the subjects in the world!
  * It can be adjusted to people with different disabilities
  * Students can learn with videos, online books/textbooks , quizzes/tests, and class work on the app while teachers can assign  classwork, quizzes, and tests 
  * Teachers and parents receive progress reports to see how their students are doing
  * During class and at home teachers can give feedback/comments to better improve learning for students
  * In class students can send signals to teachers for help so teachers can also keep track of students who need help
  * The app also comes with an online library students can use during class or at home.
  * The students can stay organized with a built in to-do list so they won't miss out on any homework or upcoming tests.
  * There's a notification button to warn students about classwork due soon.

### Skills
##### How to use feedback
During class we shared our ideas for part B and gave feedback to one another. I used the feedback I got to expand my ideas on Part B. 
##### Organization Skills
Organization helped me plan for part A which later helped me plan my part B. In class we had a lesson to synthesize part A and organize what we reseacthed into different groups/categories. This made it easier to look at my part A and think of my part B.
