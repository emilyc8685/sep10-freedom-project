### How I brainstormed Part B
 I thought of future technology in education by thinking of ways students can be more engaged in learning. Many students tend to get distracted easily while studying and teachers struggle to keep students engaged in class. Looking at pervious projects for inspiration such as [Oceanography by Austin Liu](https://austinl1905.github.io/sep10-freedom-project/) and [Cooking by Caron Voon](https://caronv3030.github.io/sep10-freedom-project/startbootstrap-small-business-master/dist/index.html#contact) i've came up with a idea where technology can help with this problem. A desk with a built in screen that comes with an educational app. 

### Engineering Design Process (EDP)
I'm on my third stage of the engineering design process which is to brainstorm possible solutions. I thought of creating a desk with a built in screen that comes with an educational app. 
* Its just a flat desk where students could have their notes on the side and also a screen built into the desk
* The app has all the subjects in the world and it can be adjusted to people with different disabilities
* Students can learn with videos, online books/textbooks , quizes/tests, and class work on the app while teachers can asign  classwork, quizes, and tests 
* Teachers and parents recive progress reports to see how their students is doing
* During class and at home teachers can give feedback/comments to better improve learning for students

##### How to use feedback
During class we shared our ideas for part B and gave feedback to one another. I used the feedback I got to expand my ideas on Part B.
